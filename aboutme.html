    In high school, I was fortunate to have many honours presented to me throughout my time at IE Weldon Secondary School. I made it onto the Principal's List (which
    was a ranking of the top 10 students in terms of GPA in the given academic year regardless of grade or stream) every year of high school, and was even the 1st in
    my class one year. By graduation, I had become close with many of my classmates and was nominated by my peers to be the 2021 Valedictorian. I submitted the video
    below as my Valedictorian Nomination Video before the class and staff had a final opportunity to vote:

  <p>My nomination was a succes and I was named the IE Weldon 2021 Valedictorian! Even with COVID-19, we were able to film a graduation speech (see below):</p>

    In addition to being my high school valedictorian in a graduating class of over 300, I was also fortunate to receive the DFO Ontario Minor Hockey Association
    scholarship before entering into university. This was a huge achievement given only 5 students in Ontario receive this award on a yearly basis. As part of the 
    scholarship, the video below was made up to share more about me:
