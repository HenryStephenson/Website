    Brief Introduction
  </h1>
  <p>
    Hello! My name is Henry Stephenson; welcome to my home page! I'm a 20-year-old Bioengineering student at McGill University with minors in both Applied
    Artificial Intelligence and Finance through the Desautels Management Faculty. 
    <br>
    <br>
    I have a keen interest in biological and biomedical research and entrepreneurship, and I enjoy studying linguistics, language (especially French, Chinese, 
    and German), classical music, Roman history, architecture, and computer science/AI. I used to play soccer at a semi-professional level and continue to have
    a love of sports (soccer, hockey, tennis, badminton, running, rugby, and everything in between). Read below to learn more about me, and check out the rest
    of the website!
